# Titanic EDA

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic disaster dataset using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Overview

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. This project analyzes the Titanic passenger data to uncover patterns and insights related to survival rates, passenger demographics, and other factors.

## Dataset

The analysis uses the classic Titanic dataset, which includes information such as:
- PassengerId
- Survived (target variable)
- Pclass (passenger class)
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp (siblings/spouses aboard)
- Parch (parents/children aboard)
- Ticket
- Fare
- Cabin
- Embarked (port of embarkation)

## Features

- Data loading and inspection
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- Summary statistics and insights

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Key Insights

- Women and children had higher survival rates than men.
- Passengers in first class had higher chances of survival compared to those in lower classes.
- Embarkation port and family size also influenced survival odds.
- Age and fare distributions provide further context to passenger demographics and class distinctions.
